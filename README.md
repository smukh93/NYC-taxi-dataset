# NYC-taxi-tip-prediction

I use data collected by the New York City Taxi and Limousine commission about “Green” Taxis. Green Taxis (as opposed to yellow ones) are taxis that are not allowed to pick up passengers inside of the densely populated areas of Manhattan. I am using NYC Taxi and Limousine trip September 2015 record data from [NYC Taxi Trip Recod Data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml). 

I have built a tip prediction model based on this data using [Random Forest Algorithm] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) and also created some interesting visualizations on inter- and intra- boroughtraffic movement, trip duration. 


This is an on-going project, so feel free to suggest improvements/new ideas. 

To-Do:

- [x] A Tip Predictor
- [x] Visualization of inter- and intra- borough traffic movement
- [ ] Can we introducde ride-sharing for NYC Green Taxis by introducing a Search Feature? 
- [ ] Use more data to see how other events (Such as weather/sports events etc.) after the service.
